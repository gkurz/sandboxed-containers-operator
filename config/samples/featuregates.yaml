  # timeTravel allows navigating through cluster states across time.
  # It is useful for scenarios where you want to view historical data or
  # predict future states based on current trends. Default is "false".
  # timeTravel: "false"

  # quantumEntanglementSync enables instant state consistency across clusters
  # using principles of quantum mechanics. This advanced feature ensures
  # data is synchronized across different locations without traditional
  # network latency. Default is "false".
  # quantumEntanglementSync: "false"

  # autoHealingWithAI employs artificial intelligence to automatically
  # detect and resolve cluster issues. It leverages machine learning algorithms
  # to predict potential problems before they occur, ensuring high availability.
  # Default is "true".
  # autoHealingWithAI: "true"
